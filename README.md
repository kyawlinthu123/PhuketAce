# 🚗 PhuketAce – Car & Motorbike Rental Website

A modern **React.js** web application for a car and motorbike rental service based in Phuket.  
This project was built as part of my practice with React — focusing on clean UI design, component structure, and responsive layouts.

## 🧭 Overview

**PhuketAce** showcases a simple yet professional rental platform where users can browse available vehicles (cars & bikes), view daily prices, and book their preferred option.  

This project is intended to simulate a real-world rental business front-end, demonstrating React fundamentals like component composition, props handling, and responsive design.
